# DoLuMa-cube-solver
A cube solver project developed in Embedded Systems classes at UTFPR - Toledo

Still a work-in-progress, but we intend on using stepper motors, an arduino and an android app that receives the cube state, calculates a solution, and sends it back to the arduino. We plan on using the kociemba's algorithm for that, from [muodov/kociemba](https://github.com/muodov/kociemba).
